(To illustrate: the standard SEAL class size is over 150 sailors. <a href="http://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/first-phase/" title="Navy SEAL Training -- Attrition">Attrition rates</a> of 70 - 80% are expected, and it is not unheard of for an <a href="http://www.socnet.com/archive/index.php/t-907.html">entire class</a> to wash out with no graduates.)</p><p>· You maintain high standards for commitment by organizing an initial period of assessment to determine which candidates are willing and able to stay with you for the long haul.</p><p>· You expect, and at times encourage, low performers and unmotivated candidates to drop out.</p><p>I know the idea of approaching dating as a recruiting strategy may seem weird or foreign to you. But consider the costs of failing to bring a systematic mindset into the world of dating:</p><p>· You hit on random women, which often leads to rejection and public humiliation.</p><p>· You waste valuable time that otherwise could have been spent meeting new people and having fun.</p><p>· You sacrifice opportunities to explore your sexuality and enjoy sensual touch -- ignoring a basic human need to the detriment of your self-confidence.</p><p>· You wind up with girlfriends who flake out on you after you've invested time and energy in getting to know them.</p><p>· You end up waiting years for "fate" or "the universe" to bring you the perfect match.</p><p>· You settle for someone you aren't really that interested in.</p><p>The best part about applying the "recruiting pipeline" system to dating is that you can stop worrying about where your next girlfriend is going to come from:</p><p>Big companies like Microsoft don’t stress when someone quits -- they just go back to their HR files and pull out a stack of resumes that have already been submitted by dozens of qualified applicants who are begging for the job!</p><p>Now you may be wondering where you are going to source these new "recruits" from: my recommended dating sites are OkCupid and Meetup.com.</p><p>Of course, a lot of guys have also had success with Match.com and Tinder. It's even possible to hack Facebook and <a href="http://www.askmen.com/dating/dating_advice/flirting-on-instagram.html" title="Flirting on Instagram">Instagram to get more dates</a>.</p><p>It’s not just a question of which platform you use -- the biggest problem is knowing how to use these tools to get the results that you deserve.</p><p>You can always experiment to find out what works, but I’ll be honest with you: it takes a lot of time to figure out the best strategies on your own.</p><p>That’s why I’m taking the hassle out of the process and sharing the techniques and scripts that enabled me to dominate the online dating scene.</p><p>Enter your e-mail address below to learn how to master the dating game from the comfort of your laptop.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 p-1 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium  text-align-left group-graphical-shape-none  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="16"><div class="Component j-c-center ls-fx-r fx-w-w a-i-end t-a-l  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="17"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="18"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="19"><img class="color-loading" data-width="1000" data-height="500" data-ratio="2" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b0f473c0fb38f11c3812f761d05eb566/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F28a0f4c2f0a67e1594ce1095743dbeac%2Fnoop.jpg%3Finput%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fstatic3.businessinsider.com%252Fimage%252F563d1fda6bb3f7546d15303a-1190-625%252Fnavy-seals-explain-how-your-ego-can-destroy-everything.jpg&amp;width=1000" style="object-position:50.05% 63.1%;" data-reactid="20"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--heading fx-b-50p" data-reactid="21"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="22"><h1 data-reactid="23"><span class="" data-reactid="24"><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/navy-seals-explain-consequences-of-ego-2015-11" class="font-title" data-reactid="25">Navy SEALs explain how your ego can destroy everything</a></span></h1></div><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="26"><h5 data-reactid="27"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="28"><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com" data-reactid="29">Business Insider</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 30 --></div></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="31"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="33"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="34"><span data-reactid="35"><!-- react-empty: 36 --><h2 data-reactid="37"><a data-reactid="38">Dominate Online Dating</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="41"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="42"></div></section></div></div>
