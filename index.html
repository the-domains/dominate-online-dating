    into consideration.</p><p>· You create a pipeline of recruits from multiple channels to diversify your options and attract a variety of talents among candidates.</p><p>· You deliberately recruit candidates in higher numbers than you currently need to fill specific roles. (To illustrate: the standard SEAL class size is over 150 sailors. <a href="http://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/first-phase/" title="Navy SEAL Training -- Attrition">Attrition rates</a>    of 70 - 80% are expected, and it is not unheard of for an <a href="http://www.socnet.com/archive/index.php/t-907.html">entire class</a> to wash out with no graduates.)</p><p>· You maintain high standards for commitment by organizing an initial period of assessment to determine which candidates are willing and able to stay with you for the long haul.</p><p>· You expect, and at times encourage, low performers and unmotivated candidates to drop out.</p><p>I know the idea of approaching dating as a recruiting strategy may seem weird or foreign to you. But consider the costs of failing to bring a systematic mindset into the world of dating:</p><p>· You hit on random women, which often leads to rejection and public humiliation.</p><p>· You waste valuable time that otherwise could have been spent meeting new people and having fun.</p><p>· You sacrifice opportunities to explore your sexuality and enjoy sensual touch -- ignoring a basic human need to the detriment of your self-confidence.</p><p>· You wind up with girlfriends who flake out on you after you've invested time and energy in getting to know them.</p><p>· You end up waiting years for "fate" or "the universe" to bring you the perfect match.</p><p>· You settle for someone you aren't really that interested in.</p><p>The best part about applying the "recruiting pipeline" system to dating is that you can stop worrying about where your next girlfriend is going to come from:</p><p>Big companies like Microsoft don’t stress when someone quits -- they just go back to their HR files and pull out a stack of resumes that have already been submitted by dozens of qualified applicants who are begging for the job!</p><p>Now you may be wondering where you are going to source these new "recruits" from: my recommended dating sites are OkCupid and <a href="http://Meetup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meetup.com</a>.</p><p>Of course, a lot of guys have also had success with <a href="http://Match.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Match.com</a> and Tinder. It's even possible to hack Facebook and <a href="http://www.askmen.com/dating/dating_advice/flirting-on-instagram.html"
