# The "Special Forces" View of Online Dating

How to Master the Dating Game from the Comfort of Your Laptop

If you want the best out of life, you have to be the best at what you do to earn the respect of the people around you. And in trying to achieve excellence, we all know it helps to study the leaders who have already reached the pinnacle of success in their field.

For instance, Elon Musk uses a ["Special Forces" view in hiring][0] new talent and retaining employees in a crisis (merely good-enough personnel won't make the cut and are laid off).

Ramit Sethi co-authored a [whole book][1] about how the most prestigious companies maintain their competitive edge with proven strategies for college recruiting, and how smaller companies can master the recruiting game by following the playbook of companies like McKinsey, Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs.

In the military word, the Navy SEALs are synonymous with preeminence in combat. As the elite operators within the U.S. arsenal, these guys need to [train for a year][2] before they are awarded their trident insignia and allowed to serve as full-fledged members of the team.

To build up this world-class force, military leaders need to bring a lot of factors into alignment among recruits, including strength, speed, mental toughness, and specialized training that will forge a skilled and highly motivated group of warriors.

And for those of us who seek to excel in private life, we can learn a lot about finding the best romantic relationships by studying the convergence between successful SEAL candidates and the needs of the organization in which they serve.

Let's compare how the process that is used to recruit Navy SEALs might be related to an effective system for getting dates, finding love, and building an outstanding relationship that will last the test of time:

\* You set basic qualifications for candidates to fulfill, such as requirements for age, physical fitness, and intelligence metrics that will help you weed out underachievers, while still allowing you the flexibility to take a substantial pool of applicants into consideration.

\* You create a pipeline of recruits from multiple channels to diversify your options and attract a variety of talents among candidates.

\* You deliberately recruit candidates in higher numbers than your current need to fill specific roles. (To illustrate: the standard SEAL class size is over 150 sailors. [Attrition rates][3] of 70 - 80% are expected, and it is not unheard of for an [entire class][4] to wash out with no successful graduates.)

\* You maintain high standards for commitment by organizing a time period of assessment to determine which candidates are willing and able to rise to the occasion.

\* You expect, and at times encourage, low performers and unmotivated candidates to drop out.

I know the idea of approaching dating as a recruiting strategy may seem weird or foreign to you. But consider the costs of failing to take a systematic mindset into the world of dating:

\* You hit on random women in public, which often leads to rejection and humiliation.

\* You waste valuable time that otherwise could have been spent meeting new people and having fun.

\* You sacrifice opportunities to explore your sexuality and enjoy sensual touch -- ignoring a basic human need to the detriment of your self-confidence.

\* You wind up with girlfriends who flake out on you after you've invested time and energy in getting to know them.

\* You end up waiting years for "fate" or "the universe" to bring you the perfect match.

\* You settle for someone you aren't really that interested in.

The best part about applying the "recruiting pipeline" system to dating is that you can stop worrying about where your next girlfriend is going to come from:

Big companies like Microsoft don't stress when someone quits and they have a job opening -- they just go back to their HR files and pull a dozen names off the hundreds of resumes sent by qualified applicants who are begging for the job!

Now you may be wondering where you are going to source these new "recruits" from: my recommended sites are OkCupid and Meetup.com.

Of course, a lot of guys have had success with Match.com and apps like Tinder. It's even possible to hack Facebook and [Instagram to get dates][5].

The point is that it's not just about which platform you use -- the key factor is knowing how to use these sites as tools to get the results that you deserve.

While it can take a lot of time to figure out the best online dating strategies by testing them on your own, I've taken the hassle out of the process by sharing the secrets and scripts that helped me dominate the dating scene.
